## Arithmetic

In this activity I am writing code to create functions capable of different arithmetic operations.

to do -
- add returns the result of num1 plus num2.


- subtract returns the result of num1 minus num2.


- multiply returns the result of num1 times num2.


- divide returns the result of num1 divided by num2.

## Odd or Even

to do -
write a  code to create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

- If num is evenly divisible by 2, return the string "even".


- If num is not evenly divisible by 2, return the string "odd".

## Log Nums

- writing code to create a function that prints all whole numbers from 1 to a given number.

- Print all numbers from 1 up to the given nums argument inclusive. For example, given the number 5 as the num argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time.

## Return sum of digits

- You are given a two-digit integer n. Return the sum of its digits.
